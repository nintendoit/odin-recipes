        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rasabali is a sweet dish from Odisha, India. Rasabali is offered to Baladevjew, and originated in the
        Baladevjew Temple of Kendrapara.It is one of the Chapana bhoga of Jagannath temple. It consists of deep fried flattened
        reddish brown patties of chhena (farmer cheese) that are soaked in thickened, sweetened milk (rabri).[3] Flattening the
        chhena into palm-sized patties is done in order to allow them to absorb the milk more readily. The thickened milk is
        also usually lightly seasoned with crushed cardamoms.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="I">
            <li>For making chenna dumplings:</li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>For making 250gm chenna - boil around 1/1 2 l milk and add vinegar. Once the milk is curdled, strain
                    the whey, collect the chenna or cheese in a cheese cloth, wash it under running water. Tied the
                    cloth tightly and let the chenna hung for one hour.</li>
                <li>To the freshly made chenna, add all the ingredients listed under For chenna dumplings, except ghee /
                    oil.</li>
                <li>Knead the chenna with the heel of your palm and mash it with your knuckles.</li>
                <li>
                    Once it is done, you will notice that your palm is greasy. Do not knead further. Chenna is ready.
                    <br>Divide the chenna into equal portions, make small balls out of it. Flatten it into round disc
                    shape.
                    <br>If possible, make a small hole at the center with your index finger.
                    <br>Keep aside.
                </li>
                <li>Heat a kadhai or deep fry pan. Add enough oil / ghee into it and heat it. I always use ghee and
                    refined oil mix. Also I do not add all the oil or ghee at once. I keep on adding it as requires.
                    This way, you wont be left with too much fried oil / ghee.</li>
                <li>Fry the chenna dumplings one by one (or max two, but do not crowded it) on low heat till reddish
                    brown on all sides.
                    <br>Take care not to over fry this. Else it will spoil the texture of rasabali and will become hard
                    and chewy.
                </li>
                <li>Drain the rasabali on kitchen towel.</li>
            </ol>
            <li>For making Reduced milk: </li>
            <ol type="1">
                <li>Boil the milk till it is reduced to half its original volume.
                    <br>Reducing the milk takes long time around 30-40 min. So before making the chenna dumplings, start
                    <br>reducing the milk first. While this is going on, you can begin with chenna dumplings.
                    <br>This will save time.
                <li>Add sugar, crushed cardamoms and saffron.
                <li>Once the milk is reduced sufficiently, check for the sweetness.
                    <br>Now add the fried rasabali into the hot milk and simmered in the milk on low heat for 3-4
                    minutes.a
                <li>Once done, switch off the heat. Cover it and let it stand for 2 hours.
                <li>Serve Rasabali at room temperature.
            </ol>
        </ol>
        <h3>Notes</h3>
        <p>You need to store leftover rasabali in the fridge. Rasabali when stored in the fridge will stiffen a bit. So
            warm it in the microwave for 10 sec before serving.</p>
