        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Considered to be one of the signature dishes of Raja Praba, Poda Pitha is a pancake-cake and one of the oldest
            sweetmeats of Odisha, perhaps dating back as 2 AD. Made of coconut, lentil and rice flour, this cake rise as a
            Raja Praba essential wasn’t just for the interesting style of cooking it, but also the nourishing aspect. In
            this three-day swing festival, which began as a tribal festival that marked the turn of sowing season, Podo
            Pitha was the one dish that once prepared could easily last for the 3-day period of the festivity without losing
            its taste. Of course, its rise of fame was thanks to Lord Jagannath, who is said to feasts on it while returning
            from his aunt’s place.</p>
